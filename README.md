# CNN_JS
CNN implementation in p5.js from scratch built on top of neural network!!

This is an example run on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
The file: brain.json contains a pre trained network.

You can visit to run the project on your browser. Although, I would recommend you just clone to your local machine.
Note: The site can take some time to load all the files if run on github pages.
